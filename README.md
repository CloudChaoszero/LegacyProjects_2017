# Legacy Projects, 2016-2017

## Overview

A consolidation of my 2016-2017 Elementary Projects. These projects were developed during my time as a teaching assistant for a Data Analytics bootcamp or "off-the-whim" project ideas from my Data Analyst Journey. 

If you have any questions on these projects, I can try to answer them--however, they were not as sufficiently developed or advanced compared to my most recent projects.
