    "\n",
    "1. **Default:** Default is failure to pay interest or principal on a loan or security when due.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. **Sovereign Default (National Default)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. **Technical Default:** result of not meeting a condition of the loan, and has nothing to do with missing a scheduled loan payment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. **Debit Service Default:** Missing a schedule payment on a loan\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. **Strategic Default:** a borrower purposely refuses to make a payment on a loan despite their ability to make the payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. **Cost Principle:** the actual cost of assets must be recorded instead of recording the cost based on market value or inflation adjustment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. **Revenue Principle:** revenue should be recorded at the time that it is earned, not at the time when payment is received. This prevents errors in accounting caused by delayed payments since any money still owed to the company is evident within the accounting ledger. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. **Matching Principle:** expenses should be matched to the revenue they are related to. The expenses are not recorded at the time they are generated, but instead are recorded once they make a contribution to revenue. This allows the profitability of goods and services to be easily evaluated and also illustrates the connection between expense and income, since products and services are directly matched with the revenue they generate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. **Disclosure Principle:** all of the financial information disclosed by a business should be released in a form that is easy to understand and that this disclosure should be balanced against the cost of compiling and releasing the information. Any information needed to understand financial statements should be included in the body of the statements, in footnotes or in supplemental documents that are provided alongside the statements. The amount of information disclosed should be sufficient for corporate executives to make decisions regarding the company; unnecessary information should be streamlined to keep the cost of producing the statements down.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Liquidity Ratio:** Measure a company's ability to pay debt obligations and its margin of safety through the calculation of metrics including the current ratio, quick ratio, and operating cash flow ratio. Current liabilities are analyzed in relation to liquid assets to evaluate the coverage of short-term debts in an emergency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. solvency: relates to a company's overall ability to pay debt obligations and continue business operations. More total assets than total liabilities to be considered solvent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. liquidity: Degree to which an asset or security can be quickly bought or sold in market without affecting asset's price. More current assets than current liabilities to be considered liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chapter 7 Bankrupty:** Common form of bankruptcy where debts are forgiven, and a variety of personal assets are liquidated to repay remaining debt as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chapter 11 Bankrupty:** Debitors are restructured in a way that debt repyayment become more achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Volatility:** Statistical measure of dispersion of returns for a given security or market index.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Credit Risk:** Risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Credit Default Risk: The risk of loss arising from a debtor being unlikely to pay its loan obligations in full or the debtor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation.\n",
